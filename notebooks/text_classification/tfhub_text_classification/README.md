# Text Classifier fine tuning with TensorFlow

These notebooks demonstrate fine tuning using various [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) models
from [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev) using IntelÂ® Optimization for TensorFlow for text classification.

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Install dependencies and setup parameters
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Build the model
1. Fine tuning and evaluation
1. Export the model
1. Reload the model and make predictions

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [TensorFlow notebook environment](/notebooks/setup.md).
