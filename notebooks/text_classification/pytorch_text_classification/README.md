# Text Classifier fine tuning with PyTorch

This notebook demonstrates fine tuning [pretrained models from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models)
using text classification datasets from the [Hugging Face Datasets catalog](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or
a custom dataset. The [IMDb Larget Movie Review dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) is used
from the Hugging Face Datasets catalog, and the [SMS Spam Collection dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)
is used as an example of a custom dataset being loaded from a csv file.

The notebook uses
[IntelÂ® Extension for PyTorch\*](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch) which extends PyTorch
with optimizations for extra performance boost on Intel hardware.

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies and setup parameters
2. Prepare the dataset
3. Prepare the Model for Fine Tuning and Evaluation
4. Export the model
5. Reload the model and make predictions

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [PyTorch notebook environment](/notebooks/setup.md).
