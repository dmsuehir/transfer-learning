# Text Classifier fine tuning with PyTorch and the IntelÂ® Transfer Learning Tool API

This notebook demonstrates how to use the Intel Transfer Learning Tool API to do fine tuning for
text classification using various [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) models
from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Install dependencies and setup parameters
1. Get the model
1. Get the dataset
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Fine tuning
1. Predict
1. Export the saved model
1. Quantization

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [PyTorch notebook environment](/notebooks/setup.md).
