# Transfer Learning for TensorFlow Image Classification using the IntelÂ® Transfer Learning Tool API

These notebooks demonstrate how to use the Intel Transfer Learning Tool API to do transfer learning for
image classification using TensorFlow and then quantize or optimize the graph for inference.

`TLT_TF_Image_Classification_Transfer_Learning.ipynb`  performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies and setup parameters
1. Get the model
1. Get the dataset
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Predict using the original model
1. Transfer learning
1. Predict
1. Export
1. Post-training quantization

`TLT_TF_Transfer_Learning_and_Graph_Optimization.ipynb`  performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies and setup parameters
1. Get the model
1. Get the dataset
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Evaluate using the original model
1. Transfer learning
1. Export
1. Graph Optimization

## Running the notebooks
