# Transfer Learning for Image Classification with TF Hub

This notebook uses transfer learning with multiple [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev) image classifiers,
[TF datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/), and custom image datasets.

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies and setup parameters
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Predict using the original model
1. Transfer Learning
1. Evaluate the model
1. Export the saved model

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [TensorFlow notebook environment](/notebooks/setup.md).
