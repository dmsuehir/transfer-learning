# Question Answering fine tuning using TensorFlow

This notebook demonstrates fine tuning using various [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) models
from [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev) using IntelÂ® Optimization for TensorFlow with the SQuAD dataset.

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies and setup parameters
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Fine tuning and evaluation
1. Export the saved model

## Running the notebooks

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [TensorFlow notebook environment](/notebooks/setup.md).
